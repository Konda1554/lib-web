# Public Library
This is a simple web application simulating a public library. It is deployed on a heroku server: https://my-own-webapp.herokuapp.com/

## PostgreSQL
It uses a heroku postgres add-on to run a remote database for deployed application.

For development purposes local instance of postgres database is used instead. Credentials are hardcoded.
